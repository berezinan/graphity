    """Stem used as the node-ID prefix for a file and its symbols.

    The full path (extension dropped) is preserved as path segments; ``make_id``
    later collapses the separators to underscores. Using every segment — not just
    the immediate parent dir (#1504) — means same-named files in different
    directories get distinct IDs instead of colliding into one
    last-writer-wins node:

        docs/v1/api/README.md -> docs/v1/api/README -> docs_v1_api_readme
        docs/v2/api/README.md -> docs/v2/api/README -> docs_v2_api_readme

    Top-level files keep a bare stem (``setup.py`` -> ``setup``). When passed an
    absolute path the whole path is encoded; the extract() id-remap post-pass
    re-derives the canonical repo-relative form from ``source_file`` so the on-disk
    location can't leak into the persisted IDs (#502).

    Returns "" for a path with no name (``Path('.')`` — a source_file that equals
    the scan root, so it has no per-file stem). Guarding here keeps
    ``path.with_suffix("")`` from raising ``ValueError: '.' has an empty name`` and
    protects every caller, not just ``_semantic_id_remap`` (#1618)."""
